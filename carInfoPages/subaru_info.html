            <div>Subaru offers excellent safety thanks to things like its standard EyeSight driver-assist systems,
                 all-wheel drive for better grip in tough conditions, and a strong reinforced body structure.
                  Its reliability is generally good, especially if you choose a model with fewer high-performance parts and keep up with maintenance.
                   On the downside, upkeep (especially things like tyres, servicing AWD components, or repairs for older models) can cost more than with simpler
                , front-wheel drive cars. Overall, a Subaru can be a very good first car if you budget for ongoing costs and pick a modest model with a solid maintenance history.</div>

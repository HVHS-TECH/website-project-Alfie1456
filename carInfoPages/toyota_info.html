<div class="flex-container">
            <div>Toyota is known for its strong reliability, with many models running smoothly for hundreds of thousands
                 of kilometres when properly maintained. Safety is generally very good, with features like Toyota Safety
                  Sense offering driver-assist technologies on most newer models. Maintenance and repair costs are usually
                   reasonable compared with other brands,
                 though some hybrid models can be more expensive to fix if issues arise. Overall, a
                  Toyota can be an excellent first car thanks to its dependability, safety features, and manageable running costs.</div>

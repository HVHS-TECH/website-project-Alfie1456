            <div>Honda is well known for being reliable and low maintenance
                , with annual repair and ownership costs generally well below average.
                 It comes with good safety technology in many models, such as adaptive
                  cruise control, collision mitigation, and lane-keeping assist, which
                   helps new drivers feel more secure. While Hondas are typically more
                    affordable than luxury brands, you'll still want to watch out for 
                    costs like insurance, fuel, and servicing on newer or high-spec models.
                     Overall, a Honda—especially a compact or modestly powered one—is one of the safest and smartest choices for a first car.</div>

            <div>Audi cars are stylish, technologically advanced, and offer lots of driver assistance and safety features,
                 which can give new drivers confidence. However, their maintenance and repair costs tend to be higher than
                  averageâ€”for example, regular services, parts, and labour are more expensive, especially if you use authorised dealerships. Models like the smaller A3 tend to be more affordable
                 to run than bigger/luxury ones, so choosing a compact or lower spec Audi helps control costs. Overall,
                  an Audi can make a great first car if you budget for the ownership costs, go for a simpler model, and maintain it well.</div>

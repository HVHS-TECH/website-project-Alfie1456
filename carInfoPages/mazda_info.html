            <div>Mazda cars are known for blending reliability with style and good driving dynamics, making them a fun yet sensible option for first-car buyers.
                 They tend to have fuel-efficient engines and decent safety/tech features, especially in newer models, which helps with running and ownership costs.
                  Older Mazdas may have some drawbacks like rust, occasional electrical or transmission issues
                , or simpler interiors compared to premium brands. All in all, a newer, well-maintained Mazda (especially a smaller hatch or crossover)
                 is a strong pick if you want something dependable and enjoyable without blowing the budget.</div>

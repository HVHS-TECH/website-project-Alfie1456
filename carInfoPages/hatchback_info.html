            <div>Hatchbacks are practical first cars thanks to their compact size,
                 making them easy to park and maneuver in city driving. They usually
                 offer good fuel efficiency and a versatile boot space that can handle both daily errands and weekend trips.
                 Maintenance costs are generally reasonable, and parts are widely available,
                  keeping running costs low. Overall, a hatchback can be a smart first car choice for beginners who want practicality, economy, and easy handling.</div>

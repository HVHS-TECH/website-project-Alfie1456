<div class="flex-container">
            <div>Lexus is a luxury brand known for its strong reliability, advanced safety features,
                 and long-lasting build quality, making it a solid choice for a first car if bought used. It offers smooth performance, a comfortable interior, and many standard safety systems that help new drivers 
                feel confident. However, Lexus vehicles can be more expensive to buy, insure,
                 and maintain than non-luxury brands. Overall, a smaller or older Lexus can be a great first car for someone wanting comfort and dependability with a bit of luxury.</div>
